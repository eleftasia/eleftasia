Hello World!
I'm Elli (she/her/hers).

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at
the University of Washington working
with Dr. Mike Ernst, Dr. Amy Ko, and Dr.
Ben Shapiro in the Programming
Languages & Software Engineering (PLSE)
and Learning, Computing, and Imagination
(LCI) research groups.

My primary research is in scientific 
software engineering. How can we make
science more efficient and more reproducible
by making it easier for scientists to write
good software? I'm also interested in
scientific computing education and in
synthetic biology.

Before coming to UW, I recieved my BS
in Computer Science from Northwestern
University.

I've previously done research at the
Center for Synthetic Biology and the
Center for Robotics and Biosystems
at Northwestern University.

I'm interested in:
- scientific computing
- software engineering
- synthetic biology
- programming languages
- computing education
```
