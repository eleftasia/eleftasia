Hello World!
I'm Elli (she/her/hers).

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at
the University of Washington working
with Dr. Mike Ernst, Dr. Amy Ko, and Dr.
Ben Shapiro in the of Programming
Languages & Software Engineering (PLSE)
and Learning, Computing, and Imagination
(LCI) research groups.

My current research is in software
engineering for scientists. How do
scientists without a computing background
approach programming and how can software
engineering research support the needs
and goals of scientists?

Before coming to UW, I recieved my BS
in Computer Science from Northwestern
University.

I'm interested in:
- programming languages,
- software engineering,
- computing education,
- scientific computing,
- making it easier for learners and non-computer
  scientists to write programs!
